            <p>
                There seems to be a true shortage of coding as a second career option. All professional fields have limited room for growth. Software development is completely open right now. There seems to be no limits to the applicability of the computing revolution to any industry, but it looks like there is no one around to do it.
            </p>

            <p>
                I hear many entrepreneurs with fast testing ideas, moving ideas from one end to another and using the incoming horde of superficial coders to make their ideas a reality.
            </p>

            <p>
                Are you the one? Could you bring your talent and knowledge to this world of software development where we're blindly steering using a sonar at best?

                            There is an astounding amount of people who start to code as if it is a paint by numbers game. I did it the same way. But I know now it's wrong. I have struggled with basic computer science problems for years and years and every time the feeling of grasping occurs I always realize there is still such a long way to go.
